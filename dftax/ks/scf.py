"""Kohn-Sham SCF: autodiff Fock + canonical orthonormalization + DIIS.

The Fock matrices are obtained by automatic differentiation of the electronic
energy, ``F_σ = sym(∂E/∂P_σ)``, exact for any XC functional and free of a
hand-coded XC potential matrix. Convergence is accelerated with Pulay DIIS on
the orthonormal-basis commutator ``Xᵀ(FPS − SPF)X``.

One solver serves both shell structures: the density is spin-stacked
``(nspin, nao, nao)`` with per-channel occupations from ``ks.nocc`` (a doubly
occupied single channel for a closed shell, unit-occupation α/β channels for a
spin-polarized system), and DIIS runs on the channel-stacked Fock/error
super-matrices, so restricted and unrestricted cases use the same solver.

The CPU solver keeps the loop in one ``lax.while_loop``. TT KS arrays are
copied to CPU for the SCF solve, then orbital and density outputs return to
TT; TT-XLA lacks several required linear algebra and autodiff kernels.

:func:`scf` wraps the solver and packs the stacked outputs into a
:class:`KSResult`.

    Args:
        ks: the built :class:`~dftax.ks.energy.KS` energy functional.
        max_iter: maximum SCF iterations.
        e_tol: convergence threshold on the total-energy change (Ha).

            An energy evaluation has a floating-point floor of roughly
            ``5e-11·|E|``, essentially all of it in the density-fitted Coulomb
            term (the RI metric pseudo-inverse retains directions down to 1e-7
            of the largest eigenvalue, so contracting against the explicit
            inverse is that ill-conditioned by construction; the XC quadrature
            and the one-electron terms are clean to 1e-14). Measured by
            sweeping the density along a line and fitting the parabola the
            energy is analytically supposed to be: 1.06e-8 Ha on cubane,
            2.30e-8 on bicyclo[2.2.2]octane, 2.07e-8 on adamantane, 3.52e-8 on
            coronene. A threshold below that is not a test but a coin flip,
            which is worth knowing before tightening this: on coronene,
            ``e_tol=1e-9`` costs 102 iterations against 10 for ``1e-8``, and
            buys 8.4e-9 Ha. The floor is far below chemical accuracy and does
            not affect any energy difference; it only limits what this
            argument can usefully be set to, and it grows with the molecule
            while the default does not.
        d_tol: convergence threshold on the DIIS commutator norm. This is the
            orbital gradient, and unlike ``e_tol`` it has no such floor, so it
            is the criterion to tighten and the one that keeps working as the
            system grows. PySCF's convention for the pair is
            ``d_tol = sqrt(e_tol)``.
        diis_space: DIIS history depth (fixed buffer size).
        lindep_thresh: overlap-eigenvalue cutoff for canonical orthonormalization.
        level_shift: Saunders-Hillier virtual level shift (Ha).
        guess: initial density, a spec from :func:`~dftax.ks.guess.core` /
            :func:`~dftax.ks.guess.sad` / :func:`~dftax.ks.guess.minao` /
            :func:`~dftax.ks.guess.sap`, or an explicit ``(nspin, nao, nao)``
            density array (warm restart). ``None`` is
            :func:`~dftax.ks.guess.minao`, falling back to the core
            Hamiltonian where the atomic densities cannot be built.
        accel: an :func:`adiis` spec runs the far-from-convergence
            iterations with ADIIS (energy-model extrapolation, no
            oscillation), blending into Pulay DIIS near the fixed point;
            ``None`` is plain Pulay DIIS. When given, its ``space``
            supersedes ``diis_space``.
        smearing: a :func:`fermi` spec replaces the integer aufbau fill with
            Fermi-Dirac fractional occupations (small-gap systems, smooth
            energies through level crossings); ``None`` is the aufbau fill.
        verbose: print per-iteration energy / error (via jax.debug.print).
