"""Batched Kohn-Sham over a stack of geometries (same atoms + basis, varying coords).

``vmap`` the per-geometry pipeline so a whole batch of conformations is evaluated in
one call, useful for ML datasets. All shapes are static across the batch (same atoms,
same basis); only the nuclear coordinates vary, so the only per-geometry array is
``centers = coords[atom_index]`` on a shared basis template.

The per-geometry solve is built from the on-device primitives (a raw
:class:`~dftax.ks.energy.System` + the spin-stacked ``_scf_solve``), bypassing the
:func:`~dftax.ks.scf.scf` wrapper whose ``float()``/``bool()`` host conversions
cannot be vmapped. A fixed-shape symmetric (Löwdin) orthonormalizer is used so the
orbital dimension is uniform across the batch; this assumes a well-conditioned basis
(no severe linear dependence), which is the conformer-dataset regime this path
targets. Exact-ERI path only.

With ``forces=True`` each element also returns the analytic Pulay-free force tensor.
Forces are *not* taken by differentiating through the SCF (the ``while_loop`` solve is
not reverse-differentiable); instead, within the same vmap, the converged orbitals
parametrize a fixed-density energy whose explicit geometry derivative is the force
(envelope theorem / stationary-point identity; see :mod:`dftax.ks.forces`).

Orbital-sized outputs (``P``/``mo_coeff``/``mo_energy``, O(B·nspin·nao²) device
memory) are opt-in via ``return_orbitals=True``; energies/forces-only runs never
retain them batch-wide. With ``mesh=`` the *batch axis* is sharded across a device
mesh (data parallelism over conformers): each device runs its own slice's solves,
with independent per-device convergence loops and no collectives.
