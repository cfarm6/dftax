"""Differentiable Kohn-Sham total energy as a function of the density matrix.

The :class:`KS` module is built directly from a system + functional +
choices-as-values:

    ks = KS(mol, PBE0(),
            grid    = becke(n_radial=75, lebedev=302),
            coulomb = df("def2-universal-jkfit"))

It precomputes the one-electron Hamiltonian and the nuclear repulsion, and
holds one Coulomb term and one XC term (see :mod:`dftax.ks.terms`) that carry
exactly the integral arrays their backend needs. It exposes ``electronic(P)``
/ ``total(P)``, a single, ``jit``/``grad``-friendly energy functional of the
**spin-stacked** density ``P`` of shape ``(nspin, nao, nao)`` (see the
convention in :mod:`dftax.ks.terms`). The KS Fock matrices are obtained
downstream as ``F_σ = sym(∂E/∂P_σ)`` (see :mod:`dftax.ks.scf`), so no
exchange-correlation potential matrix is hand-coded.

``system`` may be a native :class:`~dftax.system.molecule.Molecule` (fully
PySCF-free), a PySCF ``Mole`` (setup only; nothing PySCF enters the compute
path), or a raw :class:`System` bundle of already-built basis + geometry (the
low-level path used by forces, where the basis centers are traced). The spin
structure is the static tuple ``nocc`` of per-channel occupied counts:
``(nelec//2,)`` for a closed shell, ``(nα, nβ)`` for a spin-polarized system.
``spin=None`` infers from the system (closed shell → restricted); an explicit
``spin`` (= 2S, including 0) requests spin-polarized channels.

The Coulomb/exchange backend is a value from :func:`~dftax.ks.terms.exact` /
:func:`~dftax.ks.terms.df`:

- **density fitting** (default; ``df()`` = ``def2-universal-jkfit`` with the
  ``chunk="auto"`` memory policy): RI-J / RI-K via 3- and 2-center integrals,
  O(N³) memory (streamed to O(N²) past a budget). The fit is the robust
  Dunlap (Coulomb-metric) form; the RI error vs the exact path is sub-mHa
  with the JK-fitting auxiliary set.
- **exact** (``exact()``): the full 4-center ERI tensor (``eri4c``), tight
  against PySCF, but O(N⁴) memory: small systems and reference comparisons.
  Also the fallback for a raw :class:`System` (no element symbols to resolve
  an auxiliary basis name).

    The CPU path jits the builders (fused; eager dispatches each op unfused,
    e.g. eri4c is ~2x slower eager than jitted) and composes with grad (used
    by forces), where jit is traced inline. TT does not yet support all
    integral kernels or ``eigh``, so concrete TT inputs are built on CPU and
    the results are copied back. Traced TT rebuilds cannot use that transfer.

            dispersion: a :func:`~dftax.energy.d3.d3bj` spec adds the two-body
