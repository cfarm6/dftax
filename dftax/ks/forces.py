"""Analytic nuclear forces for Kohn-Sham DFT (closed- and open-shell).

The force on nucleus A is ``F_A = -∂E/∂R_A``. We obtain the whole force tensor
in one reverse-mode pass by differentiating the total energy w.r.t. the nuclear
coordinates, rebuilt end-to-end as a function of ``R``: the basis centers follow
their atoms, the integrals are differentiable w.r.t. those centers, and the
Becke grid moves with the nuclei. The density is held at the converged solution
through the projector parametrization ``P_σ = w Z_σ (Z_σᵀ S(R) Z_σ)⁻¹ Z_σᵀ`` with
``Z_σ`` fixed; at the SCF stationary point ``∂E/∂Z = 0``, so ``dE/dR`` reduces to
the explicit geometry derivative, which captures both the Hellmann-Feynman term
and the Pulay terms (the latter via the S(R) dependence inside the projector and
the moving basis centers). Native-``Molecule`` path only.

Under Fermi smearing the density is not a plain projector: the frozen
quantity is the full set of natural orbitals with their fractional
occupations (``P_σ = Φ B diag(f) B Φᵀ``, ``B`` the symmetric orthonormalizer
of the frozen orbitals at ``R``), and the reported force is the gradient of
the Mermin free energy. The entropy term is frozen with the occupations, so
it drops out of ``dA/dR`` and the force is again the explicit geometry
derivative at the frozen density (see :func:`_density_frac`).
