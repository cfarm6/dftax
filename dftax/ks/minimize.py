"""Direct variational minimization of the KS energy.

An alternative to the SCF fixed point: minimize ``E(P)`` directly over the
occupied MO coefficients. The free parameters are one coefficient matrix
``Z_σ`` (nao × nocc_σ) per spin channel; each defines the gauge-independent
projector density ``P_σ = w Z_σ (Z_σᵀ S Z_σ)⁻¹ Z_σᵀ`` (``w = 2`` for the
doubly-occupied closed-shell channel, ``1`` per spin channel), making the
energy a smooth, unconstrained function of the ``Z``s. The whole solve is
differentiable end-to-end, the property that makes it useful for learning over
the KS energy.

The projector is computed with ``solve`` rather than an eigendecomposition:
at the orthonormal stationary point ``ZᵀSZ ≈ I`` is fully degenerate, where
``eigh``'s derivative is ill-defined; the eigh path yields a gauge-dependent
gradient that on GPU (cuSolver) non-deterministically NaNs the minimization.
Mirrors :func:`dftax.ks.forces._density_from_Z`.

The optimizer is any ``optax.GradientTransformation`` (default
``optax.adam(0.3)``). First-order methods are the robust choice here: the KS
energy is invariant under occupied-orbital rotations, so its Hessian is
singular along that gauge, and line-search quasi-Newton solvers (BFGS /
nonlinear-CG) reliably stall at saddle points / excited determinants when
started from a core-Hamiltonian guess. Adam descends past them to the ground
state. (This matches differentiable-DFT practice, e.g. D4FT.) For a robust,
fast *energy* solver use :func:`~dftax.ks.scf.scf` (DIIS); use direct
minimization when end-to-end differentiability of the solve is what you need.
