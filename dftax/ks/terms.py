"""Composable energy terms for the Kohn-Sham Hamiltonian.

The two-electron (Coulomb + exact exchange) and exchange-correlation pieces of
the KS energy come in several execution strategies (materialized vs streamed,
exact vs density-fitted). Rather than encoding that choice as optional fields
and flag-driven branches on the energy class, each strategy is a small
:class:`equinox.Module` holding exactly the arrays it needs:

- Coulomb backends: :class:`ExactCoulomb`, :class:`StreamedExactCoulomb`,
  :class:`DFCoulomb`, :class:`StreamedDFCoulomb`.
- XC backends: :class:`GridXC` (AO values precomputed on the grid),
  :class:`StreamedGridXC` (AO recomputed per grid chunk).

Every term is a function of the **spin-stacked** density ``P`` of shape
``(nspin, nao, nao)``: ``nspin == 1`` is a closed shell (``P[0]`` doubly
occupied, ``P = 2ΣCCᵀ``), ``nspin == 2`` is spin-polarized (``P[σ] = ΣC_σC_σᵀ``,
unit occupation). :class:`~dftax.ks.energy.KS` holds one Coulomb term and one
XC term and adds ``Tr(P·Hcore) + E_nn``.

Users select a backend with the lowercase factories :func:`exact` and
:func:`df` (Optax-style: each strategy's knobs are arguments of the strategy
itself, so invalid combinations are unrepresentable):

    KS(mol, xc)                                             # exact 4c ERI
    KS(mol, xc, coulomb=exact(screen=1e-10))                # Schwarz-screened

    The hard cutoff is deliberate; smooth spectral filters were measured and
    rejected. Comparisons of density-fitted forces across independently
    converged solves differ at ~2e-6 Ha/Bohr (GPU vs CPU, batched vs serial);
    that is d_tol-level density difference amplified through the
    ill-conditioned auxiliary directions, not filter noise: at a matched
    density the paths agree to 5e-15. The same amplification bounds the
    matched-density agreement between *different contraction orders* (e.g.
    materialized vs streamed DF forces): machine precision with a
    well-conditioned auxiliary metric, ~2e-9 (H2) to ~5e-7 (water) with the
    overcomplete jkfit metric, whose kept band amplifies the reordered
    rounding by ~1e7. Tikhonov filters w/(w² + σ²) trade
    strictly worse: σ = 1e-7·w_max damps the fit-relevant band of a redundant
    h/i auxiliary metric (Fe/jkfit RI error 1.7 -> 16 mHa), σ = 1e-9·w_max
    lets the Schwarz-screening perturbation through (screened-vs-dense RI-J
    1.5e-8 Ha), and the σ = 1e-8·w_max middle ground degrades cross-backend
    force reproducibility 126x (3.3e-6 -> 4.2e-4) by re-admitting near-null
    modes whose eigenvectors rotate under backend rounding.

    A plain Cholesky inverse on the spherical-aux metric (which is genuinely
    SPD: min eigenvalue ~1e-5 water, ~1.2e-6 Cr/Fe) was also measured and
    rejected. It makes cross-backend forces essentially exact (7.6e-10
    GPU-vs-CPU, vs 4.9e-7 with this cutoff), but honestly retaining the
    near-null directions the cutoff drops (amplification up to ~8e5) stalls
    the second-order solvers: trust-region Newton hits max_iter on the
    coarse-grid water case that it otherwise closes in 6 iterations, and
    ROKS/ADIIS lose their open-shell regression cases. JK-fitting sets are
    near-redundant even in spherical form; the cutoff is load-bearing
    regularization, not a cartesian-contaminant workaround.

    Wrapped in a ``custom_jvp`` so its derivative uses the matrix identity
    ``d(V⁺) = -V⁺ (dV) V⁺`` rather than differentiating the eigendecomposition. eigh's
    backward carries ``1/(wᵢ-wⱼ)`` terms that are ill-defined at the *degenerate* metric
    eigenvalues of symmetric molecules (Td/Oh); they NaN the density-fitted forces on

    """Streamed RI-J with the auxiliary axis divided across a device mesh.

    The streamed backend never builds the ``(nao², naux)`` tensor, which is the
    only thing that fits at protein scale; this divides its auxiliary axis over
    the mesh as well, so the per-device work is ``naux/ndev`` auxiliary
    functions streamed ``chunk`` at a time. Combining the two is the point: the
    materialized aux-sharded backend still holds ``nao²·naux/ndev`` per device,
    which for insulin at triple zeta is 15 TiB.

    Each device streams its own contiguous slice of the auxiliary index range
    into its piece of ``γ``, the pieces are ``all_gather``-ed (γ is a
    ``naux``-vector, so this is negligible traffic), and the metric quadratic
    form ``½ γᵀ V⁻¹ γ`` is evaluated replicated -- the same decomposition
    :class:`ShardedDFCoulomb` uses, and for the same reason: γ is the only
    quantity that has to cross devices.

    The auxiliary basis is *replicated*, not sliced. The streamed kernel looks
    an auxiliary function up by index (``_eri3c_elem(..., k)``) instead of
    slicing a stored slab, so a device needs the whole (small) auxiliary basis
    and only its own range of ``k``. Indices are assigned contiguously and the
    range is padded to a multiple of the device count, with the padding masked
    to zero, so the gathered γ is already in auxiliary order and truncating it
    to ``naux`` is exact rather than needing a position map.

    Hybrids shard too, on a different axis: streamed RI-K sums over occupied
    orbitals, so each device scans its own slice of them and the partials are
    ``psum``-reduced (:func:`_rik_energy_sharded`). Both halves of its
    ``custom_vjp`` shard the same way, so the analytic exchange Fock it returns
    is unchanged. Range-separated hybrids ride along on the attenuated metric.
