"""Implicit differentiation of the SCF fixed point (CPHF / coupled-perturbed KS).

Energy gradients (forces, ``∂E/∂Z``) need no implicit diff: at the variational
minimum ``∂E/∂C = 0``, so the envelope theorem gives them from the explicit geometry
derivative (see :mod:`dftax.ks.forces`). What *does* need the orbital response is the
derivative of the *converged density* w.r.t. a parameter, hence first-order response
properties such as the polarizability ``α = dμ/dE``.

:func:`implicit_density` is the converged density ``P*`` as a ``custom_vjp`` function of
the assembled :class:`~dftax.ks.energy.KS`. The forward runs the ordinary SCF under
``stop_gradient``; the backward solves the response (CPHF) equation
``(I − ∂g/∂P)ᵀ w = P̄`` matrix-free; the single-SCF-step Jacobian ``∂g/∂P`` comes from
``jax.vjp`` of one step, reusing the autodiff Fock, with the eigendecomposition's
unstable derivative replaced by the stable occ-virt projector response below. Because
the backward differentiates the *assembled* functional, all Pulay / basis-derivative
terms are supplied automatically by the engine's own autodiff, with no hand-coded integral
derivatives. Backward memory is independent of the SCF iteration count.

Used now for the analytic polarizability (``polarizability(..., method="analytic")``),
where the perturbation is a one-electron field operator that never touches the grid.
The analytic *geometry Hessian* is parked (DEV NOTE, 2026-06-29): the implicit density
response ``dP*/dR`` is well-behaved (a forward CPHF solve), and the partial-assembly route
(first-order response + a fixed-density second derivative) sidesteps the second-order
``eigh`` backend bugs (CPU XNNPACK / GPU cuSolver). What remains is a NaN in the *second
geometric derivative of the energy at fixed density*. Ruled out so far: the Becke
grid-weights (freezing the grid still NaNs) and the XC kernel (both the dense and streamed
XC paths are already double-``where``-guarded at ``rho > 1e-10``, so ``eps_xc''`` is bounded
~1e16, not singular). So the culprit is most likely a **non-XC** second derivative, one of
the integral primitives (nuclear attraction / Coulomb / kinetic via the Boys / McMurchie-
Davidson recurrences), surfacing on water/O but not H2, i.e. a non-twice-differentiable op
(``sqrt``/``where`` kink/``clip``) somewhere in those kernels. NOT YET ISOLATED per term.
Once that primitive is made twice-differentiable, the partial assembly completes the
analytic Hessian. Until then the finite-difference Hessian (:mod:`dftax.ks.properties`,
first derivatives of the analytic forces; water/sto-3g freqs match PySCF to <5 cm⁻¹)
is the validated default. See ``project_engine_publish_roadmap`` memory for the full trail.

Assumes a well-conditioned basis (square Löwdin orthonormalizer) and a finite
HOMO-LUMO gap, the standard ground-state response setting. The CPHF solve is
matrix-free GMRES; its relative residual is checked after the solve and a warning
is emitted if it has not converged (it would otherwise return a wrong gradient
silently). Conditioning here is dominated by the Fock-response coupling rather
than the bare orbital gaps (uncoupled, the operator is ≈ I), so a simple gap
preconditioner does not help; a proper preconditioner is future work. Raise
``maxiter`` or fall back to ``method='fd'`` if the residual warning fires.
